Description:  This Package Installs the functions best.R, rankhospital.R, rankall.R. It also try to make 
              theme work  with efficiency using a technique to cache the data in an environment in a 
              function created for that propose. Those functions can be called individually.
              This package can be used as an Example, nothing more, maybe in the future, I will try 
              to make more generic functions, that may bring some kind of functionality to R.
