Description:  This Package Installs the functions best.R, rankhospital.R, rankall.R. It also try to make 
              them work more efficiently, using a technique to cache the data in an environment that keeps runnig in backgroung, 
              while the functions run in the Global env. The support enviroment function, simulates and object similar to what is used 
              in oop, to store state and encapsulation (where is possible), simulating getters and setters throught a list of functions 
              that is returned by the function.
              Those functions can be called individually.
              This package can be used as an Example, nothing more, maybe in the future, I will try 
              to make more generic functions, that may bring some kind of functionality to R.
