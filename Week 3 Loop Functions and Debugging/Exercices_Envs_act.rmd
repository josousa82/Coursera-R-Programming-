> ###### 3. Using parent.env() and a loop (or a recursive function), verify that the ancestors of globalenv()   include baseenv() and emptyenv(). Use the same basic idea to implement your own version of search().

```{r echo=FALSE}
e <- new.env()
e$a <- 15
e$b <-  matrix(rnorm(1:12), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
e$table <- colnames(c("col1", "clol2", "col3"))
e$table <- rownames(c("R 1", "R 2", "R 3"))
e$table <- as.table(e$b)
print(e$table)
plot(x <- sort(rnorm(47)), type = "s", main = "plot(x, type = \"s\")")
points(x, cex = .5, col = "dark red")
```
